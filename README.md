## Overview
CaughtLackin is an app designed to connect people through a fun and interactive way. CaughtLackin prompts users with different challenges that require them to take pictures of their friends doing the things in the prompt. These pictures are sent to their friends, and they must verify whether or not the prompt was fulfilled. Overall, CaughtLackin allows users to connect with one another and possibly reveal times when users run into friends unexpectedly.
